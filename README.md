# Congestion-prediction-model

The congestion level of a country is based on diferent parameters which are provided on the dataset. For the authorities of a country or city to be able to adapt according to the amount of **congestion on the cities**, this study will provide good information for us to be able to plan in the future. 

The process that i will be using is the following:
    
    - Study missing values and visualazing interesting variables.
    - Processing missing values
    - Decition making for reducing and integrating variable into the dataset for the future model.
    - Data process and adquisition of the final dataframe.
    - Modelling
